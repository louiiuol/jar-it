## What is Jar It ? 📖

You wish to work in a more **quiet** and **peaceful** place where **swearing** out loud is a faraway memory? **Jar it** will help you turn those _nasty habits_ on **occasion** to **contribute to actions you care about**! With your team, agree on the amount you will have to pay for each swears you'll dare to pronounce, and choose the association you want to support!

## How does it work ? ⚙️

Every user can register and create their _Jarees_*, and invite his team to participate. There is _no limit_ on the number of participants. The owner of the _Jaree_ can manage _roles_ for each member, giving them availability to report other members' swears.

## What is a Jaree ? 📦

**Jaree** represents collect to fund actions, associations. It starts when all members vote ready for it, after agreed on the amount for swearings, the finishing date and/or the maximum amount,  and the associations they want to support_.

## Jaree creation ? 🎉

On creation, users will have to set these 4 parameters:

* The amount of each swear (from 00.10€ to 02.00€)
* The maximum balance of the Jaree (from 05.00€ to 50.00€)
* The end date of the Jaree
* The association targeted

## What happens next ? 🤭

Once the Jaree has **started**, every time someone's _swearing out loud_, he will have to **report it** in the app. Someone else could also declare it but they will need to _be an admin_ and _justify with a quote_.
The Jaree will _keep in memory_ all swearings pronounce by the team, and do the math to resume "**who owes what**" !
When the _time is up_ or the maximal balance is _exceeded_, members will be invited to **participate in the raising** via PayPal integration.

These are the basic functionalities, Jar it will provide much more, such as  graphical charts, comparison between Jarees …
