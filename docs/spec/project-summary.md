## What is *e*.Tin ? 📖

You wish to work in a more **quiet** and **peaceful** place where **swearing** out loud is a faraway memory? **eTin** will help you turn those _nasty habits_ on **occasion** to **contribute to actions you care about**! With your team, agree on the amount you will have to pay for each swears you'll dare to pronounce, and choose the association you want to support!

## How does it work ? ⚙️

Every user can register and create their _Tinees_*, and invite his team to participate. There is _no limit_ on the number of participants. The owner of the _Tinee_ can manage _roles_ for each member, giving them availability to report other members' swears.

## What is a Tinee ? 📦

**Tinee** represents collect to fund actions, associations. It starts when all members vote ready for it, after agreed on the amount for swearings, the finishing date and/or the maximum amount,  and the associations they want to support_.

## Tinee creation ? 🎉

On creation, users will have to to set  these 4 parameters:

* The amount of each swears (from 00.10€ to 02.00€)
* The maximum balance of the Tinee (from 05.00€ to 50.00€)
* The end date of the Tinee
* The association targeted

## What happens next ? 🤭

Once the Tinee has **started**, every time someone's _swearing out loud_, he will have to **report it** in the app. Someone else could also declare it but they will need to _be an admin_ and _justify with a quote_.
The Tinee will _keep in memory_ all swearings pronounce by the team, and do the math to resume "**who owes what**" !
When the _time is up_ or the maximal balance is _exceeded_, members will be invited to **participate in the raising** via PayPal integration.

These ares the basic functionalities, e.Tin will provide much more, such as  graphical charts, comparaison between Tinees …
