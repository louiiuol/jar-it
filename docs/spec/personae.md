# Personae 🎭

## ![wiki banner](../src/img/banner.png)

The following personae are used in the project, from the conception of UX designs, to creating new User Stories presenting a feature to answer a specific need.
In each case, personae will help to put themselves in the other final user's shoes, in order to:

* Answer the need of the target as close as we can be.
* Determine better UX and UI experience based on the user's personality and disabilities
* Anticipate eventual needs based on frustrations

## Targets 👥

* The application has no pre-define target because anyone could be interested to improve their group's mood.
Still, we can define 3 main contexts where this application will be in use: **Family, friends, and colleagues**.

## Overview 🌍

_For now, we'll only focus on the third context:_ **colleagues**.

The following personae defines final users of the application. Every feature, and mockup were made with the help of those personae: 4 people work in a Software development Startup. They spend the majority of time together and have no way to isolated themself.

| Name | Role | Device
